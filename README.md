# Building-a-spam-filter-with-Naive-Bayes


In this project I'll create a spam filter using Naive Bayes classification. It is a probability algorithm based on the fact, that all features of the model are independent. In the context of the spam filter, we suppose, that every word in the message is independent of all other words and we count them with the ignorance of the context.
Our classification algorithm produces probabilities of the message to be spam or not spam by the condition of the current set of words. Calculation of the probability is based on the Bayes formula and the components of the formula are calculated based on the frequencies of the words in the whole set of messages.
